# E-Commerce System Design

Welcome to the E-Commerce System repository! This document provides an overview of the system architecture, detailing the technologies and services used to create a robust and scalable e-commerce platform.

## System Overview

The E-Commerce System is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users. It leverages various AWS services to ensure high availability, scalability, and efficient management of both frontend and backend components.

### Frontend Deployment

The frontend of the e-commerce platform is deployed using Amazon S3 and CloudFront. Amazon CloudFront ensures low-latency content delivery by distributing static assets globally, providing a responsive and fast user interface.

### Backend Microservice Deployment

The backend microservices are deployed using Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) orchestrated by an Application Load Balancer (ALB). This architecture ensures scalability and fault tolerance, allowing the platform to handle varying loads efficiently. The ALB exposes APIs for user interactions.

### Database Architecture

1. **User and Order Data**: Amazon RDS is utilized to store user and order data. A replica of this database is created to connect with an analytics application, providing insights into user behavior and trends.

2. **Product Catalog and Cart Persistent Session**: DynamoDB is employed to store product catalog information and manage persistent shopping cart sessions. This NoSQL database ensures fast and scalable access to this critical data.

3. **Users Login, Cart, and Products Cache**: Amazon ElastiCache is used for caching frequently accessed data, including user login information, cart details, and product data. This enhances the system's overall performance and reduces the load on backend services.

### Search Microservice

The search functionality is implemented using AWS ElasticSearch, providing a powerful and scalable search engine for efficiently retrieving relevant product information.

### Lambda and API Gateway

Lambda functions, combined with API Gateway, handle queries for obtaining product lists from the public internet. This serverless approach allows for dynamic scaling based on demand and simplifies the deployment and management of these specific functionalities.

### Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard is deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance, providing a dedicated environment for managing and monitoring the e-commerce system. This ensures secure access and control over administrative tasks.

### DNS and Logging

DNS management is handled by Amazon Route 53, providing a reliable and scalable domain registration service. All system logs are stored in an S3 bucket, enabling easy retrieval and analysis of system activity.

## Conclusion

This architecture aims to create a resilient and scalable e-commerce system by leveraging various AWS services. Each component plays a crucial role in ensuring optimal performance, security, and user experience. Feel free to explore specific AWS Services for detailed information on each aspect of the system.
